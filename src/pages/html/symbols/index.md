## Symbols

HTML symbol entities are characters that are not represented on a user's keyboards. Many mathematical, scientific, and currency symbols
are not present on a normal keyboard; therefore, to add such symbols to a page using HTML, the HTML entity name can be used.

If no entity name exists, either the entity number or hexadecimal reference can be used.

Examples:

```html
<p>nabla by entity: &nabla;</p>
<p>nabla by hexadecimal: &#2207;</p>
<p>nabla by decimal: &#8711;</p>
  ```
